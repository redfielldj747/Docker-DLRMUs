Docker-DLRMUs takes one or more GD45xx series scanners and upgrades/downgrades the firmware to 610099050 at the same time using detached docker containers containing DLRMUs files and instructions.

To get started, clone the repo and run buildscript.sh. You must already have Docker installed on your system. 

Next, run "sudo python3 main.py" and watch it go.
